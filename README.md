# n8n-scanner

**n8n-scanner** is a free and open-source web application that helps you identify security vulnerabilities in your n8n workflows. Upload your n8n workflow JSON file, and the app will analyze workflow nodes for **OWASP LLM Top 10**, **OWASP Agentic AI Security**, **OWASP Web Application Security**, and **n8n Security Best Practices**. Results include an interactive visualization that highlights security issues at the node level, and a summary report for your records.

## Features

- **Upload n8n Workflow JSON:** Easily load exported workflows for analysis.
- **Automated Security Scanning:** Checks each node against multiple security frameworks:
    - OWASP LLM Top 10
    - OWASP Agentic AI Security
    - OWASP Web Application Security
    - n8n Security Best Practices
- **Interactive Visualization:** View your workflow as an interactive graph, with nodes flagged if issues are detected.
- **Comprehensive Reporting:** Generate and export a summary security report.
- **Completely In-browser:** All analysis is client-side; your workflow data stays private.

## Security Frameworks

Analysis currently covers:

- **OWASP LLM Top 10:** Leading risks for Large Language Model integrations.
- **OWASP Agentic AI Security:** Risks related to agentic or autonomous features in automation[2].
- **OWASP Web Application Security:** Broad risks such as injection, XSS, unsafe deserialization, etc.
